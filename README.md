Source code for demo given during my presentation at [KitsCon 25.1](https://kits.se/kitscon/kitscon_25_1). The code is basically an implementation of the concepts shown in [this blogpost](https://pqvst.com/2023/11/21/web-push-notifications/), but with some changes of my own to explore the concepts a bit. The presentation shown is stored in [/docs](/docs).

What's in here is an exploration of [web push notifications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API/Best_Practices#overview_of_web_push_notifications). What you can do is subscribe to a topic and then send a message to subscribers of that topic (case sensitive), including yourself. The frontend is built with Svelte and hosted on GitHub pages, and the backend is a Cloudflare Worker. For storage I'm misusing Cloudflare KV for ease and convenience, and for the fact that it support a simple expiration concept, making it easy to automatically delete stored subscriptions.
